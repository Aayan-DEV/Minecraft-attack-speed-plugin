# Minecraft-attack-speed-plugin
This plugin makes it so that everytime you kill someone, you gain 0.25 attack speed and the person who gets killed, losses 0.25 attack speed! :)
------------------------------
The Minimum is 1 attack speed.
The Maximum is 6 attack speed.
------------------------------
## Other Features:
- It also makes it so that if anyone gets killed with netherite axe, the gain and lose doesn't work and the whole server gets notice that a person has a netherite sword.
